Welcome! This project is a simple but powerful Excel Sales Dashboard I built to explore sales data and present insights in a clear and interactive way.

What this dashboard does:-
Tracks total orders, revenue, and customer spending.
Shows how sales change across occasions, product categories, and cities.
Highlights weekly and hourly order patterns.
Lets you filter the data with slicers (by date or occasion) and instantly see the impact.

Key Highlights (from sample data):-
Total Orders: 29
Revenue Generated: ₹83,694
Average Spend per Customer: ₹2,886
Average Delivery Time: ~5.34 days

Some quick observations:
Anniversary and All Occasion orders bring in the most revenue.
Soft Toys, Colors, and Sweets are the most popular product categories.
Mid-week (Tuesday & Wednesday) tends to have stronger sales than weekends.
Peak order times are usually in the evening (7–9 PM).

Tools Used:-
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
Slicers for quick filtering
Conditional formatting for KPIs

Future Ideas:-
Add Power Query to refresh data automatically.
Expand the dataset to cover more months for seasonal insights.
Create a Power BI version for richer interactivity.

This project is open for learning and personal use. Feel free to adapt and improve it!
